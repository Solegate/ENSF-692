* **Built-in Git Integration**: Seamlessly manage your source control within the editor.

## üåü Getting Started with GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git, the most popular version control system. It allows developers to track changes, collaborate on projects, and maintain a history of their work. This course will cover the basics of GitHub, from creating repositories to collaborating with others.

### Key Features of GitHub

* **Version Control**: Keep track of every change made to your project.
* **Collaboration: Work** with others seamlessly, whether in small teams or large open-source projects.
* **Project Management**: Organize tasks, track issues, and manage your project's workflow.

### üìö Exploring GitHub: Core Features

**Repositories and Projects**
Repositories are where your project files and revision history are stored. Learn to:

* Create and manage repositories.
* Add and edit README files to describe your project.

**Branches and Pull Requests**
Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project simultaneously. Pull requests facilitate code review and discussion before merging changes. Learn to:

* Create and switch branches.
* Open and review pull requests.

**Issues and Project Boards**
Use issues to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs. Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. Learn to:

* Create and manage issues.
* Use project boards for better project management.

**Forking and Contributing**
Fork repositories to experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Learn to:

* Fork repositories and submit pull requests.
* Contribute to open-source projects.

## üåê Advanced GitHub Techniques

**GitHub Actions and Automation**
Automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository. Learn to:

* Set up and configure GitHub Actions.
* Automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

**Security and Access Management**
Ensure the security of your projects by managing access and monitoring vulnerabilities. Learn to:

* Configure access permissions.
* Use Dependabot for dependency management.

**Community Engagement**
Engage with the GitHub community by following users, starring repositories, and participating in discussions. Learn to:

* Build a strong GitHub profile.
* Interact with the GitHub community.
